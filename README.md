# Lip-Reading-Seb-AI

The Lip Reading AI Deep Learning algorithm was trained using the LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading scientific published paper. This algorithm uses deep learning to Read lips in a video and determine what is being stated. The algorithm uses Tensorflow and an RTX 3080 GPU to process run the algorithm. The dataset used is an extract of the original GRID dataset https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/grid, which was altered for the purpose of creating lip reading models.
